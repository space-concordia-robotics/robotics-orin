CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findarm_controller.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "arm_controller", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "arm_controller"
  with any of the following names:

    arm_controllerConfig.cmake
    arm_controller-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "arm_controller" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "arm_controller_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "arm_controller" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
